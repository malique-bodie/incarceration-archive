                            Quickly pulled up the lever and removed the old k-cup, and inserted the new one.
                            Closed lever and hesitantly looked around to see what step to do next.
                            After a couple seconds of confusion, they pressed the brew button and then quickly turned it off after the loud sound it made from brewing with no water.
                            They then looked in the back at the water tank and realized that the next step was to insert water. They filled the tank, closed the lid and saw the big button on the top was flashing so they pressed it and the coffee brewed.

                            Was very swift with all of their actions.
                            Opened the lid, removed the old cartridge and added the new one, filled the water tank, closed it and pressed the button on the top.
                            The entire process took less than a minute (not including the brew time of the coffee).
                            <br>

                        <p>
                            Actions were slightly hesitant, slowly lifted the handle and removed the old cartridge and inserted the new one.
                            Then looked around the machine to find the water tank and opened it, filled the water and closed it.
                             Pressed the flashing button on the top and finished. Made no incorrect actions but was slightly hesitant when going through the process.

                        Anxious Andre is a college student stressing to finish a project before its deadline.
                        He isn't the frequent coffee drinker, as it makes him more anxious than he already is,
                        but turns to coffee in order to successfully pull an all-nighter and complete his project.

                        This persona represents the users because it encompasses all of there experiences when
                        they first used the interface. User 1 had the same difficulties as this persona, as did
                        user 2 when they first used the Keurig. This persona illustrtes the unsureness and anxiety
                        that the interface can cause when first used.

            <h2>Confident Candice</h2>
            <div class="prow">
                <div class="pcol">
                    <p>
                        Confident Candice is a college senior, who has secured a job post-grad and is a month out
                        from graduation. Candice is the frequent coffee drinker, making a cup every morning with breakfast.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Doesn't have many issues with the interface</li>
                        <li>Views interface as streamline process that's almost habitual at this point</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        This persona represents the users once they have experience with the interface and
                        are more comfortable using it / have less problems. The second and third users interviewed
                        both had experience with the interface, and both rated the difficulty using it lower than the
                        user who had no experience. This suggests that over repeated useage the user gains confidence while
                        using the interface to the point that using it becomes habitual.
